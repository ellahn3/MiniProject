# Image classification project

The project will classify various imaging images such as Xray and colonoscopy by transfer learning.

As part of the project, a quality CNN network was developed, that includes:

• Augmentation

• Several stages of training

• Monitoring of training.

• Optimization of hyper parameters.

• Execution of Classifier based on features from the network.

### DATA:

The data contain 3 types of chest x-ray

1- Chest X-Rays in Patients with COVID-19  (Winner of the COVID-19 Dataset Award by Kaggle Community)

COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is an illness caused by a virus. This virus is a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. It spreads when a person who has the infection breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus.

2- Chest X-Rays in Patients with Pneumonia

Pneumonia is an infection in one or both of the lungs. It causes the air sacs of the lungs to fill up with fluid or pus. It can range from mild to severe, depending on the type of germ causing the infection, your age, and your overall health.

3- Normal Chest X-Rays

### results:
The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

• precision

• recall 

• F1-score

• support
