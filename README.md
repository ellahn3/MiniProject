Covid Pneumonia Classification

The project will classify various imaging images such as Xray and colonoscopy by transfer learning.

As part of the project, a quality CNN network must be developed that includes:
• Augmentation

• Several stages of training

• Monitoring of training.

• Optimization of hyper parameters.

• Execution of Classifier based on features from the network.
